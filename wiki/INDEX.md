# Wiki — Semantic Deposits

Best-guess natural language translations of formal content, laid down over time.

Most declarations have no entry here. That is not a gap to be filled — it is the
honest state of things. The semantic layer fills in when it fills in, piece by
piece, and may never be complete. The formal content does not wait for its
translation. The translations that exist are deposits, not coverage.

See `SCHEMA.md` for the convention.
