# There Is

The undeniable primitive. Before subject and object separate. Before recognizing
that there is a recognizer. Just: this.

Trying to deny it instantiates it. The denial is a presentation of denial — which
is itself something rather than nothing. You can't get outside it because the
attempt to get outside is already inside it.

Formally: a type `Presentation` that is nonempty, with a self-application map
that is a fixed point (`selfApply p = p`) and an undeniability condition
(`(Presentation → False) → False`). The fixed-point property captures the
self-returning character: applying "there is" to itself yields "there is."

This is the ground from which the derivation chain builds. Every subsequent step
(recognition, mutual determination, computation, topology, geometry) is a
consequence of this one undeniable fact.

## What gets lost in this description

The description still sounds like it's describing something from the outside.
The formal content requires that you are inside it as you read. The gap between
reading about undeniability and being in the undeniable moment is what the
`compression_loss: 3` reflects.
