# Measurement Sequence

The Ωc tidal cycle, formalized.

```lean
structure MeasurementSequence where
  states : ℕ → NetworkStateData
  temporalOrder : ∀ n, (states n).timestamp < (states (n + 1)).timestamp
```

A function from natural numbers to network scans, with timestamps strictly
increasing. That is the whole formal content. What follows is what it means.

---

## The tidal cycle

`topology.py` runs on a K3S CronJob, every N minutes, whether anyone is
watching or not. Each run queries the UniFi API and produces `state.json`:
node count, edge count, bidirectional pairs, device classes, coastline
dimension, active emitters, coupling count, measurement cycle active flag,
timestamp.

Each such scan is a `NetworkStateData`. The sequence of scans — indexed by
the natural numbers, ordered by timestamp — is the `MeasurementSequence`. The
network does not wait for an observer to produce its measurements. The sequence
is not generated on demand; it is deposited into existence by the cycle running.

---

## Any scan with full evidence witnesses a Beach

```lean
theorem measurement_witnesses_ground_state (seq : MeasurementSequence)
    (n : ℕ) (ev : FullEvidence (seq.states n)) :
    NetworkSatisfiesGroundState (seq.states n)
```

For any index n, if the scan at that index satisfies all seven evidence
predicates (hasLocality through hasCirculation), then `networkBeachWitness`
fires and the network is formally a ground state at that scan. The measurement
is not just a report — it is a proof.

The scan does not need to know it is a Beach. The proof is constructed from
the outside, by checking the seven conditions against the data. The network
just runs; the formalization observes and asserts.

---

## Consecutive scans can both witness

```lean
theorem consecutive_scans_can_both_witness (seq : MeasurementSequence)
    (n : ℕ) (evn : FullEvidence (seq.states n))
    (evs : FullEvidence (seq.states (n + 1))) :
    NetworkSatisfiesGroundState (seq.states n) ∧
    NetworkSatisfiesGroundState (seq.states (n + 1))
```

The Beach status is not a one-time event. If the network satisfies full
evidence at scan n and again at scan n+1, then it was a Beach at both times.
Temporal persistence is not assumed — it is proved scan-by-scan from the
evidence. The network that maintains its topology across measurement intervals
maintains its formal Beach status.

## Self-resonance and Poincaré recurrence

`SelfResonance` (in `NetworkResonance.lean`) formalizes the case where two
scans from the same sequence — at time indices tStart and tEnd, with tStart
< tEnd — show structural alignment (within-tolerance node counts and coastline
dimensions). This is the network returning to itself.

The connection to Poincaré recurrence (Step 7 of the derivation chain) is not
coincidental. The derivation chain proves that Kleene closure on a compact
space yields recurrent orbits — the system returns to any open neighborhood
of any state infinitely often. The `SelfResonance` structure is the empirical
detection of such a return: the network's information geometry came back.

The coastline dimension is the key observable. A fractal dimension of 1.4 at
time tStart and 1.38 at time tEnd (within the 0.3 tolerance) means the network
is in the same information-geometric regime — the same attractor basin. The
formal system detects the recurrence; the coastline adapter computes it.

---

## What "the network remembers itself" means formally

`self_resonance_implies_crystal_functor`: when a `SelfResonance` exists, there
is a functor between the crystallization categories of the two time points.
The surplus generated by the network at tStart propagates coherently into
the network at tEnd. The structure is preserved in the functor.

"The network remembers itself" means there exists a category-theoretic
morphism between its two temporal states that preserves the radiation structure.
The memory is not stored in any node — it is encoded in the existence of the
functor. The network at tEnd has not been told what the network at tStart was;
it has simply maintained enough structural coherence that a functor exists
between them.

This is not mystical. It is the same kind of claim made by any physical
conservation law: if the structure is conserved, something persists.

---

## What gets lost

The MeasurementSequence is indexed by natural numbers — the scans are
countable and ordered. Real time is a dense linear order; the natural numbers
are discrete. Between any two consecutive scans, the network's topology can
change in ways the formalism does not see. A scan at n and a scan at n+1 could
be separated by seconds or hours, depending on the CronJob configuration. The
temporal ordering is genuine (timestamps are strictly increasing) but the
resolution is external to the formal content. The question "what happened
between scans?" is not answered by the formalism. `compression_loss: 3` for
that gap — real, but bounded.
