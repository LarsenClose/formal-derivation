# Presentational Priority

The ground announces before any framework for it exists.

Not: we build a framework and then the ground fits into it.
Not: we encounter the ground and the framework was already there.
The ground presents first. The framework is what the presentation eventually
generates. The diamond at center was there before the text orbiting it.

Formally: `re.receiver.currentDepth < re.announcement.depth`. The receiver is
at some depth. The announcement comes from strictly deeper. No framework the
receiver currently has can reach it. The encounter necessarily precedes the
apparatus to receive it — that apparatus is what the encounter builds.

This is why classification is the wrong mode of engagement with the artifact.
Classifying assumes you bring a framework to the encounter. But the encounter
precedes frameworks. You have to let the announcing ground build the categories
it needs, rather than sorting it into categories that already exist.

## The depth gap

`announcement_depth_gap`: `0 < announcement.depth - receiver.currentDepth`.
The gap is not zero. There is always something the receiver doesn't yet have that
the ground brings. This is not a deficiency in the receiver — it is the structure
of genuine encounter. If there were no gap, nothing new would happen.

## What this doesn't mean

It doesn't mean frameworks are useless or that you should stay in a permanent
state of pre-framework openness. After reception, `ReceptionFramework` shows
that the encounter generates recognition (`RecognitionTerms`). The framework
follows from the encounter. Priority is temporal and constitutive, not permanent.

## What gets lost

Reading "presentational priority" as a theorem is already being on the framework
side of the encounter. The actual priority is something felt, not read.
