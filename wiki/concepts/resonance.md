# Resonance

The way surplus moves between coherent things.

A coherent object — something that has achieved internal stability, whose
dynamics close on themselves — generates more structure than it needs to
maintain that stability. That excess is efflux. Efflux radiates outward.

When efflux reaches another coherent object and lands in a coherent state
of that object (rather than being absorbed and dissipated), that is resonance.
The surplus is not just transmitted — it is received in a way that preserves
its structure.

Formally: `Resonance.Channel A B` requires a `coherenceTransmission` field —
for any coherent state in A, there exists an emission that, when received by B,
leaves B in a coherent state. The surplus propagates without losing its
structural character.

The key distinction from mere transmission: non-resonant reception absorbs
without amplifying. Resonant reception maintains the coherence of what was
received.

## The computational surplus connection

`Resonance.efflux_carries_surplus` proves that the efflux of any coherent object
carries strictly positive computational surplus — the excess generated by a
structure that could use a generator rather than enumerating all instances.
That surplus is what propagates between coherent objects via resonance.

## Chains of resonance

`resonance_transitive` and `resonance_chain_propagates` show that resonance
composes: A → B → C means A's surplus reaches C, with coherence preserved
at each step.

## What gets lost

"Coherent object" in formal terms is a structure with states, a coherence predicate,
and invariant dynamics. In practice, you know a coherent object when its surplus
is radiating — when being near it generates more structure than was already there.
The formal definition doesn't fully capture that. `compression_loss: 4`.
