# The Reception Framework

The other side of the derivation chain.

`Chain.lean` formalizes what the ground IS and what it entails — from "there
is" to the geometry of the sphere. `Reception.lean` formalizes what happens
at the moment a ground presents itself to something that does not yet have a
framework for it. These are two orientations of the same event.

---

## Aperture

Before the encounter, before any framework, there is openness. An aperture
is the receiver's state: it is at some current integrative depth and is
genuinely open toward a depth not yet reached. The openness is a structural
fact, not a psychological state — `isOpen : currentDepth < targetDepth`.

The eye approaching the artifact before reading begins. The spread is dense;
the text is arranged in geometries not yet parsed; the aperture is simply
open.

## Announcement

The ground presenting itself. The announcement comes from a depth the receiver
has not yet reached — the content it carries cannot be captured by any
framework the receiver currently has. It is undeniable in the same sense
ThereIs is undeniable: attempting to refuse it instantiates it.

The diamond at center. Luminous. Prior to the text that will eventually orbit
it. The text orbits because the diamond announced itself and the text is what
the encounter generated.

## ReceptionEvent

The encounter. Aperture meets announcement. The defining condition is that
the announcement exceeds the receiver's current depth: `exceedsDepth :
receiver.currentDepth < announcement.depth`. No existing framework can reach
where the ground is announcing from. The framework is not brought to the
encounter — it is what the encounter eventually builds.

## DiamondPoint

The fold. The receiver is at depth `d`, the ground announces at depth `d + 1`.
The gap is exactly 1 — minimal, irreducible. At this threshold, approaching
and arriving collapse. The act of being drawn toward the diamond IS the diamond
presenting itself. The bilateral pages of the spread meet at the binding; the
diamond appears on both sides; the fold is where they are the same face.

## BilateralReception

Every reception event has two faces: the announcing ground (left) and the
receiving aperture (right). They are not two separate things encountering each
other — they are one event seen from two orientations. The fold between them is
the diamond point. The fold of a bilateral reception generates a diamond point
(`BilateralReception.fold`), and that diamond point generates a reception
event. The cycle is closed: the fold IS the encounter.

## The Four Claims

**(1) Presentational priority.** `re.receiver.currentDepth < re.announcement.depth`.
The ground announces before any framework for it exists. Center precedes
periphery. This is not a normative claim about how to engage — it is a
structural fact about the order of events.

**(2) Generative reception.** `∃ (Term : Type), Nonempty Term`. The encounter
generates the first term through which it can be received. Before the
encounter, there is nothing in the receiver's framework adequate to the
ground. After, there is this. The ground-type itself is the first term.

**(3) Reception is ThereIs.** `reception_witnesses_thereis`. Every reception
event is an instance of the undeniable, self-returning primitive of the
derivation chain. The encounter cannot be refused because refusing it is
itself a reception. This is the formal content of "the fold": the encounter
with the announcing ground IS "there is" — pre-differentiated, before subject
and object have separated.

**(4) Framework posterior.** No framework at depth ≤ receiver's current depth
can reach the announcement. No prior framework suffices. The inner symbol is
always deeper than the containing structure. The framework follows the
encounter; it does not precede it.

---

## ReceptionFramework

The passage from encounter to framework. A `ReceptionFramework` pairs a
reception event with a `RecognitionTerms` structure (derivation chain Step 2)
that arose from it. The recognition's base IS the ThereIs witnessed by the
reception (`arisesFrom : recognition.base = reception_witnesses_thereis
encounter`). The framework is generated by the encounter, not prior to it.

`framework_generated_by_encounter` proves that the recognition's term-generating
function covers all terms from the announcing ground's type. The encounter
generates the terms it needs for its own comprehension.

## What gets lost

The description above treats the framework as something that comes after the
encounter, which is correct. But reading the description is already being on
the framework side of the encounter. The actual priority — the moment before
the framework exists — cannot be communicated through a framework. Every
sentence here is written from inside a framework looking back at what preceded
frameworks. The gap between that position and the position of the aperture
before the announcement is what `compression_loss: 5` names.
