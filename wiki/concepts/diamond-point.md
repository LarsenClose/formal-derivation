# Diamond Point

The fold. The binding of the book. The place in the bilateral spread where the
announcing ground and the receiving aperture are the same face.

The receiver is at depth `d`. The ground is announcing at depth `d + 1`. The gap
is exactly 1 — minimal, irreducible. At this threshold: to approach is to arrive.
Receiving and being received collapse into one event.

Formally: a `DiamondPoint` has `atBoundary : aperture.currentDepth + 1 = announcement.depth`.
That single equation is the whole thing. The `+ 1` is the gap. The `=` is the fold.

In the artifact: the diamond at center of each page of the spread is luminous —
it radiates outward — and simultaneously it is the point toward which the eye is
drawn. The announcing and receiving are the same geometry. The bilateral pages
meet at the binding; the diamond appears on both sides.

The theorem `diamond_minimal_gap` proves the depth gap is exactly 1. The theorem
`diamond_generates_reception` shows that at this threshold, the encounter
necessarily occurs — not as a choice but as a structural fact.

## The connection to ThereIs

`diamond_witnesses_thereis : DiamondPoint → ThereIs` — at the threshold encounter,
"there is" is instantiated. The diamond point is where the chain starts, encountered
from the receiver's side.

## What gets lost

The `+ 1` looks like just arithmetic. It isn't. It's the gap between knowing about
the threshold and being at it. That gap is what `compression_loss: 4` reflects.
